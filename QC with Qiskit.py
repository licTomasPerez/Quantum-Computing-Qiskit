## Bloch sphere with a color map which represents the relative phase of 
## said phase and a cycle that represents the probability of measuring that particular state.
## The relative phase of state psi1=\ket{0} is 0 and the angle indicates a 100% probability of 
## measuring \ket{0}

## Purity of said state

purity = rho1.purity()
print(purity)

## This state is pure thus, purity is equal to one.
